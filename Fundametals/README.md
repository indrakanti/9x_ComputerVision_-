# Light: A Comprehensive Overview

## 1. What is Light?
Light is an electromagnetic wave composed of oscillating electric and magnetic fields perpendicular to each other and the direction of wave propagation.

The electric field (E) and magnetic field (B) propagate through space, carrying energy and momentum. Light does not require a medium and can travel through a vacuum.

## 2. Is Light a Wave or a Particle?
Light exhibits both wave-like and particle-like properties, depending on how it is observed. This is known as **wave-particle duality**.

### Frequency, Wavelength, and Location
- **Frequency (ν)**: Number of oscillations per second (Hz).
- **Wavelength (λ)**: Distance between successive wave crests (m).
- **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle**:
  \[ \Delta x \Delta p \geq \frac{h}{2} \]
  This principle states that the more precisely the position (\(x\)) of a photon is known, the less precisely its momentum (\(p\)) can be determined, and vice versa.

## 3. Wave Interference and Fringes
Interference occurs when two or more waves overlap, leading to **constructive** (bright) and **destructive** (dark) fringes.

### **Young's Double-Slit Experiment**
One of the most famous experiments demonstrating the wave nature of light.

When light passes through two closely spaced slits, an interference pattern appears on the screen.

## 4. Properties of Light and the Light Spectrum
### Energy of Light
\[ E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \]
where:
- \( E \) = Energy of a photon
- \( h \) = Planck's constant
- \( c \) = Speed of light
- \( \lambda \) = Wavelength of light

### Point Source Casting Shadows
A point light source creates sharp shadows, but due to diffraction and reflection, light rays cannot always be traced back to their source.

## 5. Pin-Hole Camera
A pin-hole camera is a simple optical device that projects an inverted image of an object onto a surface through a small aperture.

### What if the Hole is Not Infinitely Small?
- A larger hole causes blurring due to overlapping light rays.
- An extremely small hole leads to diffraction, reducing image clarity.

## 6. Lenses and Optics
Lenses focus or diverge light rays based on their curvature.

### Convex and Concave Lenses
- **Convex Lens (Converging)**: Focuses light to a point.
- **Concave Lens (Diverging)**: Spreads light rays outward.

### Lens Formula:
\[ \frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i} \]
where:
- \( f \) = Focal length
- \( d_o \) = Object distance
- \( d_i \) = Image distance

### Image Formation by a Convex Lens

When an object is placed at different distances, the image can be real and inverted or virtual and upright.
