# Computer Vision Learn and Learn from sharing

![9X Logo](9xLogo.webp)
## Overview
This series aims to provide a structured understanding of computer vision, starting from fundamental concepts and gradually building up to more advanced techniques. Each topic will be covered in three parts:

1. **Theory** â€“ Understanding the mathematical and physical principles behind the concept.
2. **Code Implementation** â€“ Practical coding examples in C++ (and Python if time permits).
3. **Results and Visualization** â€“ Demonstrating the outputs through programmatically generated diagrams, plots, and images.

## Topics Covered
A folder for fundamentals is available to know what is light to camera to images.
